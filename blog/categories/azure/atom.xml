        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="/blog/2016/10/24/creating-an-azure-storage-adapter-for-laravel/">My earlier post about integrating Laravel and Azure storage</a> seems to have become something of a go-to resource on this subject (I suspect this is because very few developers actually use Laravel and Azure together). Unfortunately it hasn’t really aged terribly well - changes to the namespace and to Guzzle mean that it needs some work to integrate it.</p>
<p>I’ve therefore <a href="https://github.com/matthewbdaly/laravel-azure-storage">created a package for it</a>. That way, it’s easier to keep it up to date as if someone finds and fixes an issue with it, they can submit their changes back.</p>
