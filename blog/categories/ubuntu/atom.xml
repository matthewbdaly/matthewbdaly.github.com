        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For a while now it’s been obvious that I needed a new laptop. My main workhorse for a while has been a 2008 MacBook, but I’m not really a fan of Mac OS X and it was stuck on Snow Leopard, so it was somewhat behind the times. It was also painfully slow by modern standards - regenerating this site took a couple of minutes. I had two other reasonably modern laptops, but one was too big and cumbersome, while the other was a Dell Mini, which isn’t really fast enough for a developer. When I last bought a laptop, I wasn’t even a developer, so it was long past time I got a more suitable machine.</p>
<p>I therefore took the plunge and ordered a new Dell XPS 13 Developer Edition, which arrived today. It’s an absolutely beautiful machine, and it’s extremely light. It’s also a <em>lot</em> faster than any other machine I own. The screen is exceptionally sharp, and setting it up was nice and easy.</p>
<p>After an hour or so with this machine, I’m already really happy with it. We’ll have to see whether I still think so after a few months using it.</p>
