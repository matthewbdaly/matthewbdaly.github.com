        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’ve recently started using <a href="http://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a> for PHP development. It’s an incredibly useful and convenient tool - never again will I have to faff about installing XAMPP on someone’s laptop so they can demonstrate the new site, instead I can just install Vagrant and Virtualbox, clone the repository, and run <code>vagrant up</code>, and nip off and make a cuppa, safe in the knowledge that when I get back the install will be, if not done, then at least in progress. Also, it means it’s easy to run the same OS for development and production.</p>
<p>I’ve used <a href="https://puphpet.com/">PuPHPet</a> a bit, but I’ve found Puppet to be a little complex for what I wanted, so I switched to using the shell provisioner instead. As a starting point for future projects, I’ve thrown together a basic Vagrant configuration based on that provided by PuPHPet, that includes the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A full LAMP stack, running on Ubuntu 12.04</li>
<li>APC</li>
<li>PHPMyAdmin</li>
<li>Git</li>
<li>A blank SQL file - this is automatically run on <code>vagrant up</code>, so you can place any commands needed to set up your database in here.</li>
<li>msmtp - just amend the username and password in bootstrap.sh to point to a Gmail account and your web app should be able to send emails via that account quickly and easily</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s available <a href="https://github.com/matthewbdaly/vagrant-php-dev-boilerplate">here</a>, and if you haven’t discovered the benefits of Vagrant yet, it would be a good place to start.</p>
