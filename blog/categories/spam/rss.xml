            <description><![CDATA[<p>Just to say I’ve changed the contact form I use on here. I always wanted to use one with a built-in CAPTCHA facility, as Disqus seems to have pretty much killed off the comment spam, but I was still getting it via the contact form. I’ve put off doing something about it till now, but it was getting out of hand so I’ve gone and found a new contact form. Let’s hope this kills the spam…</p>
